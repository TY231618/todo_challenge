# Makers Academy Weekend Challenge: Todo List

The task is to build a Todo list as a mini front-end application.  The main technologies used will be JavaScript, Angular, CSS and HTMl.  I will be using TDD to drive the production of the app.  

Testing frameworks will include Karma for back-end and Protractor for front-end and user experience.

Here are the core user stories:
================

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice

As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```
